## Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented economic disruption, but recovery has been far from uniform across U.S. metros. This dashboard leverages the Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker dataset to visualize employment rates, consumer spending patterns, and unemployment claims at the county level. Interactive filters allow users to compare recovery trajectories across regions, industries, and income groups to understand which areas bounced back quickly and which continue to lag.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Employment recovery has been highly uneven across metros, with San Francisco still trailing pre-pandemic levels years after the initial shock. Consumer spending patterns tell a different story, with some Sun Belt metros showing strong rebounds:
